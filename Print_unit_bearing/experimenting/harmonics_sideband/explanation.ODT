Step 1–2: Loading and Extracting the Vibration Signal
    • You’re reading raw acceleration data from a CSV file.
    • The unit is m/s², which is standard for accelerometers in vibration work.
    • The sampling rate is 50,000 Hz, meaning you can theoretically analyze signals up to 25,000 Hz (Nyquist limit).
 In practical terms: This is more than enough bandwidth for bearing faults, which usually show up below 10 kHz.

Step 3: Time-Domain Plot
    • This visualizes how the vibration signal changes over time.
    • You’re showing only the first 0.1 seconds, which is smart — full datasets can be noisy and unreadable in time-domain over long durations.
    • Time-domain is useful for:
        ? Spotting impacts or transient events (sudden shocks).
        ? Seeing if the signal looks periodic (e.g., consistent cycles) or random.
This is where you'd first notice looseness, misalignment, or rubs as repeating spikes or waveforms.

Step 4: FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
    • Converts your time-domain signal into a frequency spectrum.
    • You use only the positive half of the spectrum since it's symmetrical.
    • You normalize the result to preserve amplitude accuracy.
The FFT shows which frequencies dominate the vibration. Peaks here mean consistent, repeating patterns — often tied to mechanical components.

Step 5–6: Fault Frequencies & Frequency Spectrum Plot
    • You calculate fault frequencies from known bearing defect formulas:
        ? Inner race: 14.271 × RPM / 60
        ? Outer race: 11.729 × RPM / 60
        ? Ball pass (rolling element): 10.133 × RPM / 60
    • These are kinematic frequencies that show where defects would appear if there's physical damage.
?? If you see energy (spikes) at or near these frequencies, that's a red flag.

Step 7: Zoom and Annotate Peaks in Fault Windows
    • You define a ±2% band around each fault frequency to allow for:
        ? Speed variation
        ? Spectral smearing (due to windowing or sidebands)
    • Then you find dominant peaks within each fault zone.
    • Annotating the highest local peak gives insight into:
        ? How prominent that fault frequency is.
        ? If the fault is starting or already severe.
 Very practical. In real world, machines don’t run at exactly 416 RPM — this ±2% tolerance accounts for that.

Step 8: Peak Detection in 2000–4000 Hz Band
    • You zoom into a high-frequency band and detect peaks above a set amplitude threshold (0.01 m/s²).
    • This band likely captures:
        ? Harmonics
        ? Modulation sidebands
        ? Resonances from machine structures
 This is the zone where high-frequency energy often appears due to bearing faults and modulations from shaft rotation or cage impacts.

Step 9: Harmonic Grouping
    • This is smart: you group peaks that appear to be evenly spaced (within a small error margin).
    • Harmonics usually indicate:
        ? Repeated impacts at multiples of a base frequency (e.g., unbalance at 1X, misalignment at 2X, etc.)
        ? Electromechanical issues in motors
 Detecting at least 3 harmonics gives confidence that it's not just noise.

Step 10–11: Export Harmonic Groups + Detect Sidebands
    • Sidebands = additional peaks spaced around a main frequency.
    • They occur due to Amplitude Modulation (AM) — typically:
        ? Fault frequency (modulator) modulates a high carrier (shaft or structural resonance).
    • Sidebands often show up in gear or bearing faults.
    • This step tries to:
        ? Extract those sidebands
        ? Group them by harmonic set
        ? Export for documentation
Sidebands = signature of modulation = fault energy interacting with machine stiffness or other frequencies.

Step 12: Modulation Overlay and Carrier Frequency Estimation
    • Now you overlay:
        ? Harmonics
        ? Sidebands
        ? Carrier frequencies
    • If sidebands appear symmetrically around a center (the carrier), and spacing is consistent, you likely have:
        ? AM pattern = modulation from faults
Very important for diagnosing bearing looseness, cage faults, or electrical motor bar faults.

Step 13: Spectrogram (Time-Frequency View)
    • Shows how frequencies evolve over time.
    • Useful to detect:
        ? Bursts of energy ? impacts or rubs
        ? Stable tones ? harmonics or resonances
        ? Modulated lines ? sidebands shifting due to RPM variations
The go-to tool for finding when something goes wrong, not just what frequency it happened at.

Step 14: Moving RMS and Kurtosis
    • RMS: Measures the overall energy in a signal window.
    • Kurtosis: Measures peakedness — high kurtosis = sharp impacts or outliers.
Use cases:
    • Increasing RMS = steady fault growing
    • Sudden kurtosis spike = impact event (like a cracked tooth hitting once per rotation)
    • Both rising = something big and sudden just happened
      
    •  Rolling kurtosis is especially good for early bearing faults that don’t show up in RMS yet.

Step 15: Overlay RMS & Kurtosis on Spectrogram
    • Super useful view.
    • You plot RMS and Kurtosis over time on top of the spectrogram.
    • They’re plotted at a high frequency band (e.g., 4200–4500 Hz) just to visually overlay.
You get to see:
    • Time correlation between energy bursts and statistical anomalies
    • Example:
        ? Burst at 3 kHz + kurtosis spike + RMS rise = confirmed fault event

PART 1: WHAT IS VIBRATION IN MACHINES?
Vibration = oscillation around a point of equilibrium.
When a machine runs, rotating parts (shafts, bearings, gears, etc.) never rotate perfectly smoothly. Due to imbalance, misalignment, wear, or looseness, small forces are generated — and these create vibration.
These vibrations travel through:
    • shafts
    • bearings
    • frames
    • and eventually to your sensor (accelerometer)
What your sensor is recording is acceleration — the rate of change of velocity — in m/s².

? PART 2: WHAT CAUSES VIBRATION — FAULT TYPES
Different machine faults create different vibration signatures:
Fault Type
Signature in Vibration
Imbalance
Strong peak at 1× RPM
Misalignment
Peaks at 1× and 2× RPM
Looseness
Multiple harmonics, often noisy
Bearing Defects
Sharp spikes, modulations, sidebands at specific fault frequencies
Gear Faults
Sidebands around gear mesh frequency
Electrical Faults
Peaks at multiples of line frequency (e.g. 50 Hz, 100 Hz)
These signatures appear in:
    • Time-domain as impacts or periodic patterns
    • Frequency-domain as spectral peaks
    • Spectrograms as evolving frequency patterns
    • Statistical measures as spikes (kurtosis) or trends (RMS)

? PART 3: TYPES OF ANALYSIS (that your script does)
Your script runs five primary forms of vibration analysis. Let’s go through the theory of each:

1. Time-Domain Analysis
    • You simply plot the raw acceleration signal over time.
    • Time-domain shows:
        ? Impacts (spikes)
        ? Oscillation (regular sine-like patterns)
        ? Bursts of energy (intermittent faults)
        ? Trends (increasing energy over time)
? When to use it:
To spot transient events or to confirm there's mechanical contact, such as a bearing fault that hits once per revolution.

2. Frequency-Domain Analysis (FFT)
    • FFT converts the signal into frequency content.
    • The result tells you: “how much vibration is happening at each frequency.”
    • Peaks mean: something is happening consistently at that frequency.
Example:
If the machine runs at 416 RPM = 6.93 Hz
? A spike at 6.93 Hz = imbalance
? A spike at 13.8 Hz = misalignment (2× RPM)
? A spike at 98 Hz = inner race defect (14.271 × 416 / 60)
? When to use it:
To find repeating faults like imbalance, misalignment, looseness, or bearing-specific issues.

3. Peak Detection & Harmonic Grouping
    • Real machines don’t always vibrate at just one frequency.
    • A fault may cause vibration at multiples of a frequency (e.g., 100 Hz, 200 Hz, 300 Hz).
These are called harmonics.
    • Harmonics = repeating impacts
    • 1X, 2X, 3X, etc. = key sign of faults tied to rotational symmetry
If something is hitting once every 100 Hz, you may also get smaller echoes at 200 and 300 Hz.
? When to use it:
To distinguish mechanical modulation vs. random noise.

4. Sideband & Amplitude Modulation Detection
    • Sidebands are peaks spaced symmetrically around a carrier frequency.
    • They happen when one signal modulates another.
Real-world example:
    • A bearing fault (100 Hz) modulates a shaft resonance (3000 Hz)
    • You’ll see: 2900, 3000, 3100 ? that’s a sideband set
    • Spacing of 100 Hz = modulating fault frequency
This is Amplitude Modulation (AM) — just like in radio transmission, but with mechanical energy.
? When to use it:
To confirm bearing wear, cage instability, or gear mesh issues.

5. Statistical Feature Tracking (RMS, Kurtosis)
    • RMS (Root Mean Square): average energy
        ? Goes up when a machine vibrates more
        ? Rising RMS = developing fault
    • Kurtosis: how spiky a signal is
        ? High kurtosis = sudden events
        ? Sensitive to early faults before RMS increases
Imagine RMS is your volume knob, and kurtosis is your shock detector.
? When to use it:
To track changes over time, especially for trending and early warning.

6. Spectrogram (Time-Frequency Analysis)
    • Think of it like an MRI of your signal.
    • X = time, Y = frequency, color = amplitude
    • It shows how frequency components change over time.
    • Stable horizontal lines ? stable tones (resonance or harmonics)
    • Wiggles or bursts ? modulations or impacts
? When to use it:
To catch when something went wrong, not just what frequency it's at.

? PART 4: How These All Work Together
Your script is brilliant because it layers these techniques like a forensic workflow:
    1. Plot the signal ? Did something weird happen?
    2. FFT ? What frequencies are active?
    3. Overlay fault bands ? Are these linked to known bearing fault frequencies?
    4. Zoom & Annotate ? Which exact frequency is strongest?
    5. Detect harmonics ? Is this fault repeating in time?
    6. Detect sidebands ? Is this vibration being modulated?
    7. Spectrogram ? When did the problem start, and how did it grow?
    8. RMS & kurtosis ? Is this developing? Any spikes?
    9. Overlay stats on spectrogram ? Connect energy bursts to specific machine behaviors.
You’re not just analyzing — you’re diagnosing, like a doctor using an ECG, X-ray, and MRI together.

? Practical Tips to Use This to the Max
    1. Don’t rely on one tool
Always check both time-domain, frequency-domain, and spectrogram.
    2. Zoom into interesting areas
If the spectrogram shows a burst at 1.2s and 3.6s, zoom into those segments for FFT.
    3. Know your machine's kinematics
Get bearing model numbers, gear ratios, motor pole counts. The more info, the more precise the analysis.
    4. Use kurtosis to scan long files
For long recordings, use kurtosis spikes to jump straight to impact zones.
    5. Record RPM with every sample
Without exact RPM, fault frequency overlays can be inaccurate.
    6. Compare before/after
Collect baseline vibration from a healthy machine and compare future readings to detect deviations.

? TL;DR — What You’re Really Doing
You’re turning raw acceleration signals into a diagnostic report.
You detect:
    • What frequencies dominate
    • Whether they match known fault types
    • If the vibration is steady, increasing, or bursting
    • How energy spreads across frequency and time
    • Whether modulation patterns exist
All of this can tell you:
    • Which component is failing
    • How serious the fault is
    • Whether you need to shut down now, or plan a maintenance stop soon
